### ✨ Key Features

This portfolio is more than just a static page; it's a demonstration of modern frontend development practices and a keen eye for user experience.

- **Modern & Responsive Design:** A clean, professional UI that looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop screens.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** The entire application is broken down into small, reusable React components for clean code and maintainability.
- **Dark Mode:** A sleek, user-toggleable dark theme.
- **Advanced Animations with Framer Motion:**
  - **Staggered Text Reveal:** Section headers animate in character-by-character for a witty, engaging effect.
  - **Parallax Profile Picture:** The "About Me" image gently drifts as the user scrolls, creating a sense of depth.
  - **Gooey Tab Effect:** The "Work Experience" section features a unique, fluid "gooey" animation for the active tab indicator.
  - **Professional Hover Effects:** Project cards feature a subtle zoom, overlay, and "View Project" call-to-action on hover.
  - **Scroll Progress Indicator:** A thin bar at the top of the page indicates the user's scroll depth.
  - **Functional Button Animations:** The contact form button provides clear visual feedback for "sending" and "success" states.
  - **Staggered List Reveal:** Bullet points in the "Experience" section fade, slide, and de-blur into view sequentially.
  - **Animated Accordion Icon:** The FAQ chevron icon smoothly rotates 180 degrees when a question is opened or closed.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Implemented with `lenis` for a fluid and pleasant scrolling experience.
